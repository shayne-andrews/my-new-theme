title: First week of MDS
---

Wow... so many new things to take in.

New city, new house, new people, and LOTS of new software!

Git, GitHub, GitKraken, check, check, check. I'm writing this in Markdown, which is new to me, and I can now write formulas using LaTeX, although I'm still a bit slow and need to refer to the [cheat sheet](http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf) quite often.

I'm familiar with R, but Python is entirely new to me. No worries, I'm writing R and Python code inside Jupyter notebooks every day. CSV import via pandas package, assert testing, and SciPy function documentation, I got this.

Stats is all review so far for me, but will be doing more advanced topics in to time. It's nice to walk before running with this one.

I'm not really surprised by any of this though, I knew it would be intense from day one. Intense was probably the most common word I've heard used to describe this 10-month Masters of Data Science program.

However, I have been surprised by the communications course which is part of block 1. It is awesome! The instructor is a former MDS grad, and has a very engaging style. We've talked about the curse of knowledge and I found the idea of using bottom up explanations (use examples first, then label with concepts) extremely useful. Also, we talked today about writing in [classic style](http://classicprose.com/), which gives a label and structure to the sort of thing I aspire to:
> The writer and reader are equals. The writer gives the reader credit for understanding that the world is complicated, and doesnâ€™t apologize constantly. The reader trusts the writer to make sense of an uncertain world.

One week down, only 42 weeks to go until [capstone projects](https://ubc-mds.github.io/capstone/about/) are complete and I'm ready for graduation. Bring it on!
